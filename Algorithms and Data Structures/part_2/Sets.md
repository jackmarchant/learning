# Sets
A Set is a collection of any type of object, as long as they are comparable to each other, for example: integers, strings etc.
Sets can contain an infinite or limited number of values, and must have unique values.
Sets have typical collection methods such as a count, enumerator, adding and removing items.

## Set Algorithms
- __Union__
Contains all the **unique** items of each set.
- __Intersection__
Contains all of the items in **both** sets.
- __Set Difference__
Result of items in one set, that do not exist in another set.
- __Symmetric Difference__
Set difference of union and intersection algorithms. 
Symmetric difference of `{1, 2, 3}` and `{2, 3, 4}` is `{1, 4}`
The intersection of the first two sets is `{2, 3}`, and the union is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, so the set difference of those sets is `{1, 4}`.
